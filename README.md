my first project documentation for Data Analysis with The Incubator Hub 

### Project Title:
Data Analysis for Business growth and productivity 

### Project Overview:
This data analysis project aims to generate meaningful insights into sales products performance and their different locations. By examining various data parameters, we seek to gather valuable insights into customer preferences, market dynamics, and sales performance  which then help us know  and identify top performers from our data, tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gathered and then enable us to make a data driven decision that would fuel business productivity and growth. 


### Data Sources
The dataset used for this project is an open source data provided by our facilitator Muhsin, H. and it can be freely downloaded at kaggle, Fred and other open data sources.

  1. Data Cleaning and formatting
  2. Data Analysis
  3. Data Visualisation. 
- SQL - Structured Query Language [Download here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/SQL-server-downloads)
  1. Querying of data
  2. Storing data
  3. Retrieving data

  1. To build a portfolio
  2. Collaboration
  3. Networking
 - Power BI
   1. Data Visualisation
   2. Data modelling
   3. Data reporting 


### Cleaning and Data Preparation
In the initial phase of data cleaning and preparation, we carried out the following tasks:
 1. Data loading and inspection.
 2. Handling missing variables.
 3. Data cleaning and formatting. 


### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involved the exploring of data to answer some questions about the data such as: 
- What is the overall sales trend? 
- What is the sales performance across different regions
- Which products are the top sellers? 


### Data Analysis 
---Excel
The Randbetween function is used to generate random numbers in excel and interestingly, it's a volatile function. (i.e. It continually updates as changes are being done on the workbook). 
Pivot table
Vlookup function. Cell referencing, etc. 

```Excel
 =Rand between (10000, 50000)
```

```Excel
= Vlookup(E9, 'Simple Salary Structure'! $B$8:$I$16,2,0)
  ```

---SQL 
I learnt how to create tables in SQL, insert values into the table created and run several queries by highlighting the statement and executing it. The query below is to check for staffs who earned more than 700000 and to convert datatype VARCHAR to INTEGER datatype


```SQL
SELECT * FROM Salary Where salary >700000
```

``` SQL 
ALTER TABLE Payment
ALTER COLUMN Staffid VARCHAR (max) 
```

--- Power BI 
This is amazingly interesting. From the entering of data to transforming data and loading data, the View panes, previewing of data. Every step I'd taken on power BI had been fun though I'd just started with the tool. 


### Data Visualisation
